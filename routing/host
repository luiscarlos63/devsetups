# Step 1: Verify IP Forwarding
    Ensure that your PC is configured to forward packets between interfaces.

    Check if IP forwarding is enabled:
        `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

    If it outputs 0, IP forwarding is disabled.
    Enable it temporarily:
        `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

    NOTE: To make it permanent, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and set:
        `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`
    
    Then apply the changes:
        `sudo sysctl -p`


# Step 2: Check NAT (Masquerading) Rules
    Check existing iptables rules:
        `sudo iptables -t nat -L -v`

    Add the NAT rule if missing:
        `sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE`

    Allow forwarded traffic: Add rules to allow forwarding between the interfaces:
        `sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlp0s20f3 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT`
        `sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o wlp0s20f3 -j ACCEPT`
